                Hello, My name is Josue, I'm from Chihuahua, Mexico but I'm currently living in Utah. I like to learn new coding languages and hang out with my wife in my free time. I like to play video games but I don't consider myself a gamer.

                Chihuahua is the biggest state in Mexico. Even though Chihuahua is the biggest state in Mexico, it's the one with the lowest population and highest oldest population in all of Mexico. It's bordered by Texas and New Mexico in the north. Its clime is similar to Las Vegas Nevada; most of the territory is a desert and a small part of the state has sierra (mountain range). Mennonites are living on the north side of the state (they make the best cheese in the state).
